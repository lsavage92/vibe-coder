- Add a general prompt to include writing tests which match the described functionality. The tests should also be ran to make sure it's working. If there are testing or linting failures, fix _all_ of them in one go. If there are still failures, fix them and re-run the tests. Do not use this as the prompt, create the most effective prompt to ensure that Claude Code achieves the desired result.
- Remove retention and average session length as metrics
- Remove Cloud save, mobile app and analytics from "Technical Improvements"
- Do not change anything else

What do I actually need to give to Claude Code in order to ensure it has the proper context when executing the prompts? Do I give it the entire PRD and tell it to execute Task 1? What is the most effective approach?
